{"name":"Macwidgets","tagline":"A collection of Mac style widgets written in Java","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JTWalraven/macwidgets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JTWalraven/macwidgets)\r\n\r\nCollection of Mac style widgets written in Java\r\n\r\n##What are \"Mac Widgets for Java\"?\r\n\r\nMac Widgets for Java is a collection of widgets seen in OS X applications, offered through a Java API. These widgets help Java developers create Mac themed applications. Their usage is not restricted to Mac though, as they will render across platforms.\r\n\r\n##Guiding Design Principle\r\n\r\nMacwidgets has been designed as components - so you won't see much inheritance. Component style designs help make the API simple and understandable. This stye of design also makes it easy for developers to use the components as they were intended to be used.\r\n\r\n##Screenshot\r\n![Mac Theme Screenshot](http://jtwalraven.github.io/assets/images/2013-05-29/JavaMacTheming5.png)\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n\r\nTo use in Gradle or Maven simply add `com.jtechdev:macwidgets:1.0.1` as a dependency.\r\n\r\n* [Examples](https://github.com/JTWalraven/macwidgets/wiki/Examples)\r\n* [Tutorial](http://jtwalraven.github.io/2013/05/29/style-java-application-for-mac-os-x/)\r\n* [JavaDoc](http://jtwalraven.github.io/macwidgets/javadoc/)\r\n\r\n##License\r\n    macwidgets - Collection of Mac style widgets written in Java\r\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Jeffrey Walraven\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
