These widgets help Java developers create more Mac-like applications. Their usage is not restricted to Mac though, as they will render across platforms.\r\n\r\n##Guiding Design Principle\r\n\r\nMac Widgets for Java have been designed as components - so you won't see much inheritance. Component style designs help make the API simple and understandable. This stye of design also makes it easy for developers to use the components as they were intended to be used.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n    macwidgets - Collection of Mac style widgets written in Java\r\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Jeffrey Walraven\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
